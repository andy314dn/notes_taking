/proc fs: an interface that allows the kernel to communicate info about each
	running process on a Linux system

sysfs is not representative of an actual physical device.  Instead, sysfs
	models specific kernel objects such as physical devices and provides
	a way to associate devices with device drivers.
We can get some idea of what kinds of objects are exported by looking directly
	at the directory structure exported by sysfs.
sysfs provides a top-level subdirectory for several system elements, including
	the system buses.

loop-back device: a pseudo-device that makes a 'file' accessible as a
	'block device'

'hyperthreaded' processors: chips that implement multiple, virtual CPUs sharing
	a single processor core and cache.
